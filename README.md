### Installation

2. Install required node modules (dependencies):
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Build and run:
    ```sh
    grunt serve     // build dev + start express server + watch js & less for changes (all that is needed for local dev)
    grunt dev       // just build in development mode
    grunt dist      // build for production
    grunt test      // run the karma(frontend) and mocha(backend) tests
    grunt test:e2e  // run the protractor end-to-end tests
    grunt eslint    // run the eslint checks for both the UI and server
    
    cd to sample/server   run node app.js  // starts the server with all your changes and runs any existing UI, saves you having to bundle and copy the UI during DB work
    ```
